# Andrea Santagati | Cybersecurity Portfolio

## üöÄ Junior GRC | Threat Intelligence | Security Risk Analyst

Welcome to my Cybersecurity portfolio! I am a highly analytical and results-driven Cybersecurity Master's graduate with a solid foundation in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), network defense, and offensive security. My goal is to launch a career in GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance), Threat Intelligence, or Security Risk Analysis, with the ambition to evolve towards CISO roles.

Through academic projects and practical simulations, I have developed skills in risk assessment, security policy creation, and adversarial attack analysis, focusing on pragmatic solutions in dynamic environments.

### üíº Featured Projects

These simulated projects demonstrate my ability to apply cybersecurity principles to real-world scenarios, creating fundamental documents and analyses.

#### **1. Risk Assessment for AethelGuard Solutions**
*   **Description:** Detailed cyber risk analysis for AethelGuard Solutions, a fictional endpoint protection software company. This project identifies critical assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and proposes a 90-day mitigation roadmap, aligned with NIST and ISO standards.
*   **Key Outcomes:** Identification of 6 prioritized critical risks (P1/P2) with specific recommendations and an implementable roadmap.
*   **Methodologies/Standards:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, ISO 31000, ISO/IEC 27005.
*   **[View Risk Assessment (PDF)](./AethelGuard_Solutions_Risk_Assessment.pdf)**

#### **2. Access Control Policy for AethelGuard Solutions**
*   **Description:** Development of a comprehensive access control policy for AethelGuard Solutions, defining principles, roles, responsibilities, and processes for secure management of access to systems, data, and physical assets. Includes requirements for MFA, PAM, auditing, and compliance.
*   **Key Outcomes:** Policy structured around Least Privilege, Need-to-Know, and Separation of Duties, with clear guidelines for provisioning, authentication, and privileged access management.
*   **Methodologies/Standards:** ISO 27001 (Annex A.9), GDPR, PAM Best Practices.
